The iterating processes of RFIC design using Cadence Virtuoso can be broken down into several key stages, each involving potential iterations based on simulation and verification outcomes. Below is a detailed breakdown:

Schematic Design:
The process begins with schematic capture using the Virtuoso Schematic Editor. Designers create the circuit at the transistor level or use higher-level behavioral models for initial stages. This step allows for the definition of design variables and parameters, which can be adjusted later for optimization.
For RFICs, this includes designing components like mixers, transceivers, power amplifiers, and phase-locked loops (PLLs), as noted in the Virtuoso RF Solution documentation.
Pre-layout Simulation:
Pre-layout simulation is conducted using the Virtuoso ADE (Analog Design Environment) Assembler and Spectre Simulators, including the Spectre RF Option. This stage verifies the functionality and performance of the circuit under various conditions, such as frequency response, power consumption, and noise figure.
RF-specific analyses, such as harmonic balance, shooting Newton engines, fast envelope modeling, and high-capacity S-parameter data simulation, are integral. These simulations help identify potential issues before layout, reducing later iterations.
If simulations reveal performance gaps, designers may iterate by adjusting the schematic, such as modifying component values or adding compensation circuits.
Layout Design:
The physical layout is created using the Virtuoso Layout Suite XL, which supports connectivity-driven editing for correct-by-construction layouts. For RFICs, layout considerations include minimizing parasitic effects, ensuring proper grounding, and optimizing for electromagnetic compatibility.
The layout must adhere to design rules, and features like multi-threaded and distributed processing enhance productivity, as mentioned in the Virtuoso Layout Suite documentation.
Parasitic Extraction:
Post-layout, parasitic extraction is performed using the Quantus Extraction Solution to model resistance, capacitance, and inductance introduced by the layout. This step is critical for RFICs, as parasitics can significantly impact high-frequency performance.
The extracted netlist is used for subsequent simulations, and any significant parasitic effects may necessitate layout adjustments, triggering another iteration.
Post-layout Simulation:
Post-layout simulation is conducted again with the extracted parasitics to verify that the layout meets performance specifications. This involves using the Virtuoso ADE Suite and Spectre Simulators, ensuring consistency between pre- and post-layout results.
RF-specific simulations, such as S-parameter extraction and noise figure analysis, are repeated to assess high-frequency behavior. If performance degrades, designers iterate by refining the layout or schematic.
Verification and Physical Checks:
Verification includes layout versus schematic (LVS) and layout versus abstract (LVA) checks using Virtuoso IPVS, ensuring the layout accurately reflects the schematic. Design rule checking (DRC) and design for manufacturing (DFM) are also performed to guarantee manufacturability.
Any discrepancies identified during verification may require iterations, such as correcting layout errors or adjusting the schematic to align with layout constraints.
Electromagnetic (EM) Analysis:
For RFICs, electromagnetic effects are critical due to high-frequency operation. Cadenceâ€™s Clarity 3D Solver and EMX Planar 3D Solver, integrated into the Virtuoso RF Solution, automate EM analysis for passive components and interconnects.
This step enables multiple design experiments, as designers can iterate by adjusting component placement or layout to minimize EM interference, such as reducing coupling or improving isolation.
Co-design and System-Level Integration:
The Edit-in-Concert Technology in Virtuoso RF Solution allows designers to edit across layouts and view changes immediately at the system level. This is particularly useful for RFIC and SiP (System-in-Package) module co-design, ensuring correct connectivity between bumps or bond wires.
This feature reduces manual effort and error-prone tasks, facilitating iterations by enabling simultaneous editing of IC and module layouts, as described in the layout co-design documentation.
Iteration and Optimization:
The design flow is highly iterative, following a meet-in-the-middle approach where top-level (high-abstraction) and lower-level (transistor/behavioral) designs proceed concurrently. High-abstraction blocks are gradually replaced with transistor-level views for accuracy, as outlined in the Custom IC Design Flow/Methodology.
For example, a Flash ADC design, as referenced in the methodology, involves iterating through schematic/layout design, pre-layout simulation, extraction, post-layout simulation, and GDSII file creation. Each stage can be run independently or through the entire flow, allowing for targeted iterations based on specific issues.
Designers may need to cycle back to earlier stages, such as modifying the schematic if post-layout simulations show performance degradation, or adjusting the layout if EM analysis reveals interference. This process continues until all specifications are met.
Finalization and Fabrication:
Once the design is validated, the GDSII file is generated using the Virtuoso Layout Suite for submission to the foundry. This marks the end of the iterative design process, but iterations may still occur if foundry feedback requires adjustments.
